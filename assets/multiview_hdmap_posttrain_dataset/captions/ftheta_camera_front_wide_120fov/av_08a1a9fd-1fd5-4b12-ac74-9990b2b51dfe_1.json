    "caption": "This multi-camera perspective captures a drive along a multi-lane urban freeway during the daytime under a hazy or partly cloudy sky. The vehicle travels in one of the right lanes, flanked on one side by a high retaining wall featuring a concrete base and a brown, brick-patterned upper section with some climbing vines, and on the other side by a concrete median barrier. As the car moves forward, it approaches and passes under a large concrete overpass, which frames a view of a distant downtown city skyline with numerous high-rise buildings. A green freeway sign for the \"Hill St / Grand Ave\" exit is briefly visible, and another overpass, distinguished by its overhead catenary power lines suggesting a light rail system, also crosses the roadway. The flow of traffic is moderate, with the camera vehicle sharing the road with other cars, including a white Dodge Grand Caravan minivan, a dark-colored SUV, and a black sedan, which are visible at various points ahead and behind. The asphalt road surface shows some visible cracks and wear, contributing to the overall scene of a typical day on a major metropolitan highway."
