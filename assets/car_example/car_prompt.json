    "prompt": "The video is a driving scene through a modern urban environment on a snowy winter day, likely captured from a dashcam or a similar fixed camera setup inside a vehicle. The scene unfolds on a wide, multi-lane road flanked by tall, modern buildings with glass facades partially covered in frost and snow. Snow blankets the sidewalks and tree branches, while light snow continues to fall, creating a serene and cold atmosphere. The road surface is wet and slushy, with visible tire tracks from vehicles that have passed. The vehicle moves steadily, and a black car ahead maintains a cautious speed, its taillights reflecting softly on the wet pavement.On both sides of the road, bare trees line the sidewalk, their branches dusted with snow. A few pedestrians, bundled up in winter coats and scarves, walk carefully to avoid icy patches. The buildings feature a mix of modern glass structures and traditional concrete exteriors, with some windows glowing warmly from interior lights, contrasting the cold surroundings. Snow piles can be seen near the curbs and along the building edges.Traffic cones are still placed on the road ahead, partially surrounded by slush, indicating ongoing roadwork despite the weather. The road markings are faintly visible under the snow, with white arrows showing through in some areas. The gray winter sky diffuses the sunlight, casting a soft, cool light over the entire scene. The atmosphere is calm and quiet, typical of a city during a heavy snowfall when traffic is light and the world seems slower.",
    "negative_prompt": "The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all."
